ConceptNet
==========

ConceptNet aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of information that ordinary people know but usually leave unstated.

The data in ConceptNet was collected from ordinary people who contributed it over the Web. ConceptNet represents this data in the form of a semantic network, and makes it available to be used in natural language processing and intelligent user interfaces.

This API provides Python code with access to ConceptNet 4, and the natural language tools necessary to work with it. It uses Django for interacting with the database. Documentation for this code is available at: http://csc.media.mit.edu/docs/conceptnet/
