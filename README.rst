ConceptNet
==========

ConceptNet aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of information that ordinary
people know but usually leave unstated.

This Python package contains a toolset for loading new datasets into ConceptNet 5, and it serves the HTML
and JSON Web APIs for it. You don't need it to simply access ConceptNet 5; see
http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu for more information.
