Standing on a building I am a lightning rod
And all these clouds are so familiar
Descending from the mountain tops the gods are threatening.
I will return an honest soldier

Steady on this high rise like every lightning rod
And all these clouds are boiling over
Swimming in adrenaline the sky is caving in
but I will remain the honest soldier.
