Ideas for representing ConceptNet without SQL
=============================================

Document types
--------------

Edge:

- type: 'statement', 'assertion', 'semantic', 'dependency', 'feature'...
- dataset: language
- text: (best sentence)
- justifications: an AND/OR tree of reasons to believe it
- nodes: (list; hopefully at least 2)
- label: the label on the edge
- frequency: how often it's true
- confidence: generated from justifications
- weight: generated from frequency and confidence
- valid: T/F
- history: (list of [timestamp, description])

Node:

- type: 'node'
- id: (normalized name)
- text: (best un-normalized name)
- dataset: language
- edges: (list)
- valid: T/F

FreeText:

- type: 'sentence'
- dataset
- tokens: (list)
- valid: T/F
- confidence
- justifications
